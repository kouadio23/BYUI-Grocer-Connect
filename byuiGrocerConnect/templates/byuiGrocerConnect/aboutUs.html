        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            At BYUI Grocer Connect, we aim to simplify and improve the grocery shopping process for the BYU-I student community. Our platform facilitates a unique peer-to-peer grocery shopping experience, enabling students to either list their grocery needs or volunteer to pick up groceries for others. This not only makes shopping more convenient but also fosters a sense of community and service among students.
